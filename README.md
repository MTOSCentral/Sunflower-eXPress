# What/Why is it different from the normal version of Sunflower?
Sunflower is based on Flask, a python we framework, and eXPress is based on the well... express.js framework, which brings performance improvements for at least 10-20%.

## Why do I keep the Flask edition if that is the case?
Sunflower eXPress is meant for Sunflower365, which is the subscription based Saas(Software as a service), which needs a more scalable framework, eXPress edition will receive update *LESS FREQUENTLY*. This is for users who are willing to try something NEW and LESS STABLE(not 365). Because I am more fimiliar with Flask, the Flask version will be maintained first, then the eXPress edition, so Less Updates, Less Features.

## Comparing Both Of Them
- While flask version is more stable and more features, it provides less performance, its kernel is better and has a better codebase overall.
- The eXPress version however is more, well...eXPress, faster, but less features.
